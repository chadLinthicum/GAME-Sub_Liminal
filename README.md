In this game, the player takes on the role of a submarine trapped in a confined liminal space. Unlike other submarine games that involve exploration, this game takes place entirely within a single room. The objective of the game is to survive as long as possible by avoiding a mysterious growing energy that threatens the player's vessel. The energy may start small, but it grows in intensity as time passes, making it increasingly difficult for the player to avoid!
